## Tech Stack

-   Vue JS
-   SCSS
-   Supabase

## Why We Used

### Vue JS

We used VUE JS cuz making this project with HTML and Vanilla JS was pretty difficult and also it will make the code messy, that's why we thought that using a JavaScript framework will be an easier approach.

### SCSS

We used SCSS cuz it adds superpowers to Vanilla CSS. We could have used Vanilla CSS too but using it in a big project might makes the code messier and hard to understand. Our team love to use SCSS over Vanilla CSS so that's also a reason why we chose it.

### Supabase

Supabase is always our team's go-to backend on hackathons. Not only it's fast and powerful but also very easy to integrate on our project within few clicks unlike firebase, which requires a lot of configuration.
